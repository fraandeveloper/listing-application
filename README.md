# Getting started


You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:

`$ npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Run the application

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.

1.  Navigate to the workspace folder, such as  `listing-application`.
    
2.  Run the following command:

`cd listing-application ` <br />
`$ npm install` <br />
`$ ng serve`
